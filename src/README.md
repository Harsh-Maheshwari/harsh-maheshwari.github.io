### The Process
!!! anotate "Discover The Potential"
	1. **Initial Consultation**: We schedule an initial consultation with the client to understand their business needs and goals for the project. During this consultation, we gather information about their data, current processes, and desired outcomes. We also discuss potential cost savings or revenue increases that can be achieved through the use of machine learning.
	2. **Data Analysis**: We conduct a thorough analysis of the client's data to understand its structure, quality, and potential for use in machine learning models. We also identify any inefficiencies in the client's current data storing and database practices that can be improved through the use of best practices. Additionally, we will discuss the use of open source data and publicly available datasets that can be used to enhance the client's data and improve the performance of the models.
	3. **Problem Identification**: We work with the client to identify any industry-specific or business-specific problems that can be addressed. This includes analyzing the client's business operations and identifying key areas where machine learning / automation can improve efficiency, reduce costs, or increase revenue.
	4. **Feature Engineering**: Based on our experience and your domain knowledge, we create new features and modify existing features in your data that can help improve the performance of a machine learning model. It helps to extract valuable insights and information from raw data that ultimately lead to increased efficiency and accuracy of model and better revenue for your business.
	5. **Model Selection**: Based on the data analysis and the client's goals, we select the appropriate machine learning models and techniques to be used in the project. We also ensure that the selected models are cost-effective and have the potential to generate a positive return on investment for the client.
	6. **Model Development**: We develop and train the chosen models using the client's data and open source data or other publicly available datasets. This may include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning. We also implement automated processes to reduce manual labor and costs for the client. During this step we also make sure that the data is stored and handled in compliance with the industry standards and best practices for data storage and data base.
	7. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the performance of the developed models and make any necessary adjustments to improve their accuracy. We also provide the client with metrics to measure the financial impact of the models and the benefits of implementing best data storing and database practices.
	8. **Deployment**: We deploy the final model(s) in a production environment, and provide the client with instructions on how to use and maintain them. We also provide support to integrate the models with the client's existing systems and processes and data storing and database infrastructure.
	9. **Maintenance and Support**: We provide ongoing support and maintenance for the deployed models to ensure they continue to perform well over time. We also monitor the financial impact of the models and provide updates to the client on cost savings or revenue increases achieved. This also includes addressing any new problems or issues that arise in the industry or business.

## <center>**Our Beliefs**</center>
![GoGiver](/Assets/img/GoGiver.webp){width=50%, align=left}
As a technology heavy company, we strive to be at the forefront of experimentation with new research, new ideas and development of an open source community. And our beliefs have helped us in achieving this task. The Go-Giver, written by Bob Burg and John David Mann, has been a cornerstone philosophy at our company. This business fable emphasizes the importance of giving in order to achieve success has been a guiding principle for our business practices. By focusing on giving more in value than we take in payment, we have been able to build strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our customers, community, and employees. We have implemented this principle in various ways throughout our business practices, such as by consistently over-delivering on our promises to customers, and by actively seeking out ways to give back to our community. This approach has not only led to greater success and fulfillment for our business, but it has also allowed us to make a positive impact in the world. We are proud to be a Go-Giver company and continue to strive towards this principle in all that we do. Quoting one more important line from the book : "The more you know, the less you need to say." This line emphasizes the importance of listening, learning, and understanding in order to build effective relationships. It suggests that the people who truly know their stuff, don't feel the need to constantly prove it by talking about it. Instead, they listen attentively, ask questions, and take the time to truly understand the needs and perspectives of others. This line is a powerful reminder that effective communication is not just about talking, but also about listening and understanding. As a business we have tried to integrate this in our practices. These values have guided us along a sustainable path towards success and happiness of doing something good in the world. We humbly suggest you to give this book a try and see your life change.
