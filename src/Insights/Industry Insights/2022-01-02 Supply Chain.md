## Supply Chain Management

### Three broad levels
1. **Strategic Level** SCM takes in the entire scope of a company's supply chain network and processes. It addresses the major long-term elements in a comprehensive strategy, including the type and number of facilities, technologies and suppliers.   
2. **Tactical Level** nails down the specific means of executing the strategy, be they production schedules, logistics processes, contracts or software applications. Time horizons are shorter than in strategic SCM. Here's where standards and best practices are identified for key deliverables such as customer service, efficiency and cost.
3. **Operational Level** encompasses the daily operations of SCM. Forecasting, production scheduling, shipping and invoicing are typical operational tasks.


### Data Science in Supply Chain 

#### PREDICTING SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS
Supply chain data analytics gives companies the ability to predict supply disruptions and make adjustments before problems impact production. Companies can also look at trending data on weather events, political instability, or financial issues that may impact a supplier’s ability to deliver on schedule. With this information, teams can make alternate plans as needed so they can maintain normal operations.

#### QUALITY ASSURANCE
Manufacturing companies use real-time data analysis for quality assurance. Using IoT-enabled cameras and measuring devices, a manufacturer can identify issues before a product is shipped to retailers or consumers.

#### WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT
Information gathered on warehouse temperature, shelf weight, and load weight can be used to optimize warehouse operations and improve productivity. Analytics can inform receiving, tracking, and storing inventory, as well as workload planning, managing shipping, and monitoring the movement of items in the warehouse.

#### LOGISTICS
Data [analytics is used in logistics](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/blog/8-ways-big-data-analytics-is-improving-logistics/) to plan more efficient delivery routes and reduce fuel consumption. Companies can use data to identify the ideal mode of transportation for their loads.

#### SALES, INVENTORY, AND OPERATIONS PLANNING
Retailers can analyze point-of-sale (POS), inventory, and production volume data to identify misalignment in supply and demand. As a result, they can determine when to place orders with suppliers, which products to put on sale when, and when to launch new product offerings.

#### Demand planning
Demand planning is a process for gathering historical data, such as past sales, and applying analytics and statistical modeling to create a forecast or demand plan that the sales department and operational departments -- for example, manufacturing and marketing -- can agree on. The forecast determines the types and quantities of products to be manufactured. Getting the forecast right is critical for avoiding costly problems such as the [bullwhip effect](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/bullwhip-effect), in which small fluctuations in retail demand are magnified further up the supply chain, leading to severe shortages or surpluses of inventory.
   
#### Production planning
Production planning,the company nails down the specifics of where and how the products called for in the demand plan will be manufactured. A more fine-tuned variation called advanced planning and scheduling & optimization seeks to optimize the resources that go into production and make them more responsive to changes in demand.
   
#### Material requirements planning 
**[MRP](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/material-requirements-planning-MRP)** is used to ensure sufficient materials and components, such as subassemblies, are available for use in the manufacturing process by taking inventory of what's on hand, identifying gaps, and buying or making the remaining items. The central document in both MRP and production planning is the bill of materials ([BOM](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/bill-of-materials-BoM)), a complete list of the items needed to make a product. MRP is sometimes done as part of manufacturing resource planning ([MRP II](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Manufacturing-resource-planning-MRP-II)), which broadens the MRP concept to other departments such as HR and finance. 

#### **Inventory management**
**Inventory management** consists of various techniques and formulas for ensuring adequate supply -- from raw materials in a manufacturing plant, perhaps managed in an [MRP system](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/tip/How-manufacturers-can-use-an-MRP-system-to-reduce-inventory), to packaged goods in a retail store -- for the least expenditure of time and resources.

Manufacturers are faced with a variety of [inventory management issues](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/feature/The-top-five-inventory-management-challenges-for-manufacturers-and-how-to-address-them), many of which involve coordinating demand planning with inventory at both ends of the production process. For example, sometimes MRP leads to _more_ inventory -- especially when the system is first implemented -- and the manufacturer must work to synchronize MRP parameters with the inventory already on hand.

#### Procurement
Sometimes called _sourcing_, **procurement** is the process of finding suppliers for goods, managing those relationships and acquiring the goods economically -- along with all the communication, such as sending out requests for bids, and paperwork, including purchase orders and invoices.

1. _[Strategic sourcing](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/strategic-sourcing)_ is an elevated and more sophisticated type of procurement that aims to optimize a company's sourcing process by taking advantage of its consolidated purchasing power and aligning it with business goals.

2. [Supplier relationship management (SRM)](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/supplier-relationship-management-SRM), in contrast, addresses sourcing issues by focusing on the suppliers the company deems most critical to success and systematically strengthening relationships with them while fostering optimal performance. 

#### Logistics
**[Logistics](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/logistics)** covers the transporting and storing of goods, from the delivery of parts and raw materials to manufacturers or processors to the delivery of finished products to stores or direct to consumers, and even beyond for product servicing, return and recycling -- a process called _reverse logistics_. Inventory management is threaded throughout the logistics process.

### Goals of SCM
-   cost savings from acquiring goods and services as cheaply as possible and minimizing expenses on capital goods, such as inventory, facilities and equipment;
-   efficiency that comes from avoiding waste and duplication;
-   revenue increases from meeting higher levels of demand with sufficient supply;
-   profit from lower costs and higher revenue;
-   customer satisfaction from balancing supply and demand, and delivering the products consumers want;
-   quality improvements from sourcing better materials, avoiding production errors and gathering customer feedback; and
-   stability from effective risk management, visibility and collaboration.
-   better relationships with suppliers, distributors and retailers;
-   improved brand image;
-   environmental sustainability;
-   improved cash flow;
-   safer products and services;
-   lower overhead;
-   improved accountability and compliance; and
-   more innovation.

### Sources of Supply Chain Alternate Data
1. **Trade (Shipping) Data:** 
	Shipping/Trade data is a collection of information on ships, cargo, owners, shipbuilders, movements, fixtures, causalities, ports, and companies. Shipping data is perhaps the most obvious and widely-used dataset category to consider when undertaking supply chain analysis. Trade data comes from government import/export data and bill of lading data at the port level. The coverage typically includes all products and commodities shipped globally. These products and commodities can frequently be tied back to individual companies or rolled up for sector insights.
2. **Satellite Data:** 
	Satellite data provides information on both commodities and manufacturing plants where products and materials are traveling from, but also offers information on vessel movements and port activity for shipping data. Satellite data can be harnessed for supply chain analysis to make better choices, anticipate issues, and re-route material flows to minimise disruption. For investors, satellite data is most valuable for tracking sea freight. The value of satellite data relative to import/export data provided by trade data is that the data is more timely – often real-time. It’s possible to see in real-time if a vessel is stuck at a port like LA and how many ships are floating offshore
3. **Flight Data:** 
	Flight data provides end-to-end information on cargo and the movements of aircraft through alerts and tracking. Flight data, specifically as regards cargo traffic, can be valuable for analysing supply chain dynamics for higher value or time-sensitive goods such as pharmaceuticals, tech, and luxury goods, or items that need to be expedited. However, unlike sea freight discussed previously, it’s not possible to see “inside the container” for air freight so it’s not always clear what is being shipped.
4. **IoT & Geolocation**: 
	IoT devices allow companies to understand where goods are, how they are being stored, and when they can be expected at a specific location. For Ex: authenticating the location of goods in real-time, tracking speed of movement, monitoring of storage conditions, streamlining the movement and location of goods, and validation of arrival.
5. **Other Data for Supply Chain Tracking:** 
	Other datasets worth exploring in the context of supply chain analysis are credit datasets, ESG datasets, firmographic and reference data, NLP on public text data, and crawled data for analysis of stock-outs at online retailers.
